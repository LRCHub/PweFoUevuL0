Hey boy I like the way you talk
I like the way you speed dial
Me on that phone
I like that XG when I hear that ringtone
I'm liking everything but it's not enough
Say boy
What if I wanna ride
What if I'm in a mood
And I need you right now
What if you're with your crew
And I needed you to bounce
Feel like you should
Kick it on another night ah yea
Normally I never get this crazy
My reality is all you lately
All I'm really trying to say right now is
Boy you came and
Rocked the boat
Rock the boat
Caught me off the beat like
Shaking up the streamline
Rocked the boat
Knocked me off that wave (wave)
Boy you came and
Rocked the boat
Rock the boat
Swimming in the deep wide
Open in the sea I'm
Off the boat
Knocked me off that wave (wave)
Boy you came in
Hot
The way you got me hot
You turned it up a notch
Sped up a couple knots
Then I felt the
Drop
My heart wouldn't stop
You got me sweating Okinawa
In the summertime
Who would've thought?
Ok we could take it two ways
Liyah worked the middle while
Singing on top of blue waves
I had to look away but it was too late
I drank the Kool-Aid
I really thought that it was Gucci
Maybe it was bootlegged
No my mama wouldn't ever let me
Hypothetically you mine already
All I'm really trying to say right now is
Boy you came and
Rocked the boat
Rock the boat
Caught me off the beat like
Shaking up the streamline
Rocked the boat
Knocked me off that wave (wave)
Boy you came and
Rocked the boat
Rock the boat
Swimming in the deep wide
Open in the sea I'm
Off the boat
Knocked me off that wave (wave)
Boy you came in
XO
You playing that game
Back to back
You been calling all day
Back and forth
Calling even my friends
Even on text
Leaving non sense
Don't trip boy
Give me my space
Obsession was never my thing
Take your time
You should steady your pace
What am I saying?
Boy you came and
Rocked the boat
Rock the boat
Caught me off the beat like
Shaking up the streamline
Rocked the boat
Knocked me off that wave (wave)
Boy you came and
Rocked the boat
Rock the boat
Swimming in the deep wide
Open in the sea I'm
Off the boat
Knocked me off that wave (wave)
Boy you came in
