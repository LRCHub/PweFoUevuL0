Get down to the beat
Give some body heat
If you've got the notion, do some locomotion
Rock the boat, rock the boat)
So I'd like to know where you got the notion?
Say, I'd like to know where you got the notion?
(Rock the boat) Don't rock the boat, baby
(Rock the boat) Don't tip the boat over
(Rock the boat) Don't rock the boat, baby
(Rock the boat)
Ever since our voyage of love began, your touch has thrilled me like the rush of the wind
And your arms have held me safe from a rolling sea
There's always been a quiet place to harbour you and me
Our love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo full of love and devotion
So I'd like to know where you got the notion?
Say, I'd like to know where you got the notion?
(Rock the boat) Don't rock the boat, baby
(Rock the boat) Don't tip the boat over
(Rock the boat) Don't rock the boat, baby
(Rock the boat)
Up to now we sailed through every storm
And I've always had your tender lips to keep me warm
Oh, I need to have the strength that flows from you
Don't let me drift away my dear, when love can see me through
Our love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo full of love and devotion
So I'd like to know where you got the notion?
Say, I'd like to know where you got the notion?
